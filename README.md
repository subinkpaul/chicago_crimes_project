### Problem Statement
------


The Chicago city police department has collected a large dataset of crimes that have occurred in the city over the past several years, and they are looking to analyze this data in order to better understand crime patterns and trends. However, the dataset is currently in a CSV format and is not optimized for efficient querying and analysis. Therefore, developing an end to end data pipeline that can transform the CSV data into a format that is more suitable for analysis.  The goal of this project is to create a streamlined and efficient process for analyzing crime data that can be used to inform decision-making and improve public safety in the city.
